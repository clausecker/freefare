This is a Go wrapper for the libfreefare. It has been written against version
0.4.0 of the libfreefare.  As the libfreefare is going to incorporate some
breaking changes in an upcoming version, breaking changes are likely to occur.
However, these are going to affect new versions of this wrapper only.  You may
safely assume that the 0.3 branch will continue to work with libfreefare 0.4.0
indefinitely.  Furthermore note that the code is largely untested and should
not be used in production code without further testing.

Please notice that this release contains a possibly memory corrupting issue in
freefare.DESFireTag.ReadData() and freefare.DESFireTag.ReadRecords(). This issue
is caused by a bug in the libfreefare that is likely to be fixed in a future
version of libfreefare.

The current release of this wrapper is release 0.3. Successive releases will be
placed in different subfolders as to not change the semantics of code that links
against a specific version of this wrapper. The general folder structure is

    github.com/fuzxxl/freefare/<version>/freefare

The following versions are special:

* latest always points to the latest version
* dev is the version that is currently under development

Note that this scheme is going to change with the next major release as I plan
to adapt Go modules.  Compatibility with existing code based on the 0.3 branch
is going to be maintained with no changes on your part required.
