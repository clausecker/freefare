This is a Go wrapper for the libfreefare.

You need the following libfreefare version to use this code:

 - version v0.3.2 needs libfreefare version 0.4.0
 - version v0.4.0 needs libfreefare commit b83cbcb of 2019-10-29 or later

As the libfreefare is going to incorporate some breaking changes in the upcoming
version 1.0.0, breaking changes are likely to occur.  Furthermore note that the
code is largely unmaintained and should not be used in production code without
further testing.

Please notice that this release contains a possibly memory corrupting issue in
freefare.DESFireTag.ReadData() and freefare.DESFireTag.ReadRecords(). This issue
is caused by a bug in the libfreefare that is likely to be fixed in a future
version of libfreefare.

This package uses Go modules.  To import it, use the import path

    import "github.com/clausecker/freefare"

Pkg-config is used to find libfreefare automatically.  If this does not work,
you can compile with tag nopkgconfig or no_pkgconfig to instruct the package to
instead simply link with -lfreefare.  You'll then have to manually set things up
for suitable -I... and -L... options to be supplied so the header files and
library are found.

Compatibility with existing code based on the old 0.3 branch is going to be
maintained with no changes on your part required.  I do recommend that any user
switches to the Go module based structure if possible though.
