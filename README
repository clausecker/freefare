This is a Go wrapper for the libfreefare.  A recent (post 0.4.0 but pre breaking
1.0.0 changes) git checkout of the libfreefare is needed.  As the libfreefare is
going to incorporate some breaking changes in the upcoming version 1.0.0, breaking
changes are likely to occur.  Furthermore note that the code is largely
unmaintained and should not be used in production code without further testing.

Please notice that this release contains a possibly memory corrupting issue in
freefare.DESFireTag.ReadData() and freefare.DESFireTag.ReadRecords(). This issue
is caused by a bug in the libfreefare that is likely to be fixed in a future
version of libfreefare.

This package uses Go modules.  To import it, use the import path

    import "github.com/clausecker/freefare"

Compatibility with existing code based on the old 0.3 branch is going to be
maintained with no changes on your part required.  I do recommend that any user
switches to the Go module based structure if possible though.
