Each item is prefixed with one of the following letters:

 K Known bug
 C compatible expansion without adding new symbols
 I incompatible change
 N new function, method or variable in the API
 R general remark

Release 0.1 (2014-03-29):
 R initial release. This release is a tentative release to get work on
   my libopenkey wrapper started. A lot of functionality for DESFire
   tags is still missing in this version. If you want to fiddle around
   with them, please wait for the next version of this wrapper.

Release 0.2 (2014-04-10):
 I Bump nfc dependency to 1.0.
 I Rename constants to fit Go naming conventions.
 C Amend the freefare.Tag interface. This is a compatible extension as
   you're not supposed to create custom types that implement this
   interface.
 N Add wrappers for all the remaining libfreefare functionality
 N Add method freefare.Tag.TranslateError() which might be useful for
   people who want to wrap libfreefare-based C code with this wrapper.
 B Fix a couple of bugs.
 B Work around a couple of bugs in the libfreefare.
 K Using freefare.DESFireTag.ReadData() or
   freefare.DESFireTag.ReadRecords() might cause memory corruption as
   the underlying libfreefare functions may write more data to buf then
   specified. This issue will be fixed as soon as I figure out a
   relyable way to tell how much extra space I need.

Release 0.3 (2014-08-30):
 I Bump nfc dependency to 2.0. This is required to make the library
   compile once more.
 I Rename some fields to fit Go naming conventions.
 C Rename some function parameters.

Release 0.3.1 (2019-02-04):
 R This release is found in the 0.3 directory
 B Avoid naming files aux.* for Windows NT compatibility

Release 0.4.0 (2020-09-14):
 B Fix issues #4, #5, #6 as well as some other problems
 R Bump nfc dependency to 2.1.4.  This means libnfc version 1.8.0 or
   later will be needed.
 R Switch to Go modules.
 I Rename import path as I have renamed my github account.  The new
   import path is

       http://github.com/clausecker/freefare

   The old import path as well as the 0.3 branch will continue to work
   if and only if not operating in module mode.

Release 0.3.2 (2024-04-20):
 R Bump nfc dependency to 2.2.0.  This means libnfc version 1.8.0 or
   later will be needed.
 R Switch to Go modules.
 R This version exists as a backport of the 0.4.0 changes without the
   new features so the module can be used with libfreefare 0.4.0.
 I Switch to Go modules and rename import path as with v0.4.0.

Release 0.4.1 (2024-04-21)
 R document libfreefare dependency to be some post 0.4.0 git checkout
   due to the recently added MifareKeyDeriver code (cf. PR #8, issue #9)
 C add support for finding libfreefare using pkg-config
 C bump github.com/clausecker/nfc dependency to v2.2.0
